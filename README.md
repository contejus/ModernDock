# ModernDock

This repo is a fork of [NoisyFlake's ModernDock repository](https://github.com/NoisyFlake/ModernDock). Please check out his work and other tweaks. Thanks to NoisyFlake for the source code and making it publicly available!

## Installation

Assuming you have Theos installed and configured to deploy to your iOS device over SSH:  

1. Run `make do`
2. Press the Sleep or Home button on your iOS device (for me, this was necessary to respring after installation)  
3. Check that the tweak is installed by seeing if your dock is curved.

## Supported Devices

I have only tested this tweak on an iPhone 6 running iOS 12.4.6 on checkra1n 0.10.1. Other devices and operating systems have not been tested.
